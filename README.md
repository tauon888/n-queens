# n-queens
Python script to solve the n-queens problem.

This is based on:

1. Thorsten Altenkirk's excellent book:

   Conceptual Programming in Python - http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszit/cp.html

2. Neetcode's excellent algorithm for testing column and diagonal occupancy
using sets - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph95IHmRp5M
